<section><h2>Mission</h2>

  <p>I (MisterTicot) created Cosmic.Plus with the following goals in mind:</p>

  <ul>

    <li>Providing end-users with some fundamental high-quality softwares.</li>

    <li>Providing an high-level open source development kit for Stellar
    applications.</li>

    <li>Defending the interests of the community by promoting balanced &
    vendor-neutral solutions for the technical challenges we're facing.</li>

    <li>Coordinating with other developers that are making efforts in the same
    direction.</li>

  </ul>

<section><h2>Philosophy</h2>

  <p>Cosmic.Plus embraces the cooperative mindset of the free software
  community. I believe that in a competitive space, it is critically important
  that some independent actors are able to contribute without having their
  private interest directly at stake.</p>

  <p>Each Cosmic.Plus software get released under a permissive open source
  licence (MIT). What is made publicly available doesn't need to be coded time
  and time again. This enables my fellow developers to focus on what makes their
  applications unique, which ultimately benefit to end users.</p>

  <p>Important design choices are publicly discussed with the community prior
  to implementation, and feedback is systematically taken into account.</p>

<section><h2>Economic Model</h2>

  <p>Naturally, achieving those goals comes at a cost. However, it would not be
  possible to "play it fair" while relying on aggressive monetization
  strategies. Hence, this project runs a non-profit, ethical economic
  model.</p>

  <p>So far, I financed it thanks to Build Challenges the Stellar Development
  Foundation organized. In the future, I'll try to finance the hard work from
  other kinds of contest and from donations.</p>

  <p>I'm conscious that maintaining such standard is a demanding challenge. I'm
  confident that Cosmic.Plus can reach economic stability thanks to community &
  SDF support.</p>

<section><h2>Privacy</h2>

  <p>Privacy is a right. Cosmic.Plus pieces applications don't use ads/trackers
  and don't collect/publish data about users activity. However, Cosmic.Plus web
  applications are distributed through GitHub, Cloudflare and to a lesser extend
  Azure. Those services may keep logs about who is using the apps.</p>

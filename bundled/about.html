<section><h2>Mission</h2>

  <ul>

    <li>Release well-crafted open-source applications that demonstrate the
      unique potential of Stellar.</li>

    <li>Provide a high-level open-source development kit to build Stellar
      applications.</li>

    <li>Implement and promote a way to secure users funds by decoupling wallets
      from other services (CosmicLink protocol, SEP-0007).</li>

    <li>Defend the interests of the community by promoting balanced &
      vendor-neutral solutions at the protocol level (CAP, SEP).</li>

    <li>Promote free software as a solution to globally raise the quality of the
      Stellar ecosystem.</li>

  </ul>

<section><h2>Philosophy</h2>

  <p>Cosmic.Plus embraces the cooperative mindset of the free software
  community. Each Cosmic.Plus product gets released in the public domain, under
  the MIT license.</p>

  <p>In a competitive space such as the Stellar ecosystem, most actors
  strive to create an edge against competitors. The drawback is that features
  that could benefit the whole space are generally jailed in private code
  repositories.</p>

  <p>By releasing software & libraries in the public domain, Cosmic.Plus
  globally improve Stellar's network quality. Instead of coding the same
  functionalities, again and again, developers are offered an opportunity to
  focus on what makes their software unique.</p>

<section><h2>Economic Model</h2>

  <p>It is always a bit tricky to profitably develop open-source software over
  the long-term. So far, Cosmic.Plus financed itself thanks to programs such as
  the Stellar Build Contest or the Stellar Community Fund</p>

  <p>While the research & development budget is not secured yet, a fund
  exclusively dedicated to long-term maintenance has been put aside. This
  guarantees that, in any scenario, Cosmic.Plus existing products will remain
  up-to-date for years.</p>

  <p>There are ongoing plans to make Cosmic.Plus financially independent without
  sacrificing its ethic. Realistically, this could take a couple of years to
  achieve.</p>

<section><h2>Privacy</h2>

  <p>Privacy is a right. Cosmic.Plus applications and libraries don't use
  ads nor trackers and don't collect or publish data about users activity.
  However, Cosmic.Plus web applications are distributed through GitHub,
  Cloudflare and to a lesser extent Azure. Those services may keep logs about
  user activity.</p>
